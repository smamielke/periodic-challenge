      Hi! I'm <strong>Sam Mielke</strong>, a <strong>Chemistry major at the University of Maryland</strong> with a deep passion for science and discovery.  
      I created <em>Periodic Challenge</em> to make chemistry learning more interactive, approachable, and fun for everyone — from students just starting out to lifelong science lovers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Science has always fascinated me — the way atoms form everything around us, the patterns of the periodic table, and the incredible stories behind each element.  
      This project is my way of sharing that excitement and helping others see how amazing chemistry can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for visiting, playing, and supporting this little experiment in science learning!  
      Keep exploring, stay curious, and never stop asking questions. ⚛️
